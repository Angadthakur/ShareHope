# ShareHope
## CryptoDroids (Android Team - GDSC GTBIT)

ShareHope is a decentralized donations application which aims towards providing NGO's 
and other welfare organizations easy access to donors and post pleas for donations, 
grants, social service etc.

The heart of this app lies in the fact that it is decentralized, i.e. no third party will
be involved in between the donor and organization, thus allowing for complete P2P network,
through blockchains.

New organizations that wish to register themselves will the app, will go through a verification process
by selected "Validators" on the network.
These validators will be selected at random and we will employ Proof Of Stake principle to prevent 
misbehaviour from the validator side. The organizations thus approved will join the platform and can post
donation pleas or camps.

New donation plea will be released by the organizations through Smart Contracts, and will be
visible to all users on the blockchain. Once the target is achieved the Smart Contract will 
automatically close and the money will be transferred to the organization.
